# underWaters
An interactive water simulation utilizing Open CV & Media Pipe to track hand gestures, and vector operations for water surface & water ripple effects.

This project required multiple iterations and testing, beginning with p5.js prototyping and eventually fleshing it out within Python.  I utilized the matrix library Numpy to simulate wave equations using previous and present values of pixels. I did a similar approach for creating fluid simulations with an algorithm for solving ordinary differential equations quickly. I then took these improved visuals and synced it with Open CV and Mediapipe for the final result.
